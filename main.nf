// Developer notes
//
// This template workflow provides a basic structure to copy in order
// to create a new workflow. Current recommended practices are:
//     i) create a simple command-line interface.
//    ii) include an abstract workflow scope named "pipeline" to be used
//        in a module fashion
//   iii) a second concrete, but anonymous, workflow scope to be used
//        as an entry point when using this workflow in isolation.
